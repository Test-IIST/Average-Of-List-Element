# Average of List Elements 

## Description:
Write a Python program that calculates the average of elements in a list of integers.

### Input
- A list of `n` integers, where each integer is between -10^6 and 10^6.

### Constraints
- The list can contain at most 1000 elements.

### Output
- Print the average of the elements in the list (Integer part only).

### Examples
```
Input:
5
List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output:
Average: 3

Explanation:
The average of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is (1+2+3+4+5)/5 = 15/5 = 3.

Input:
3
List: [10, 20, 30]

Output:
Average: 20
