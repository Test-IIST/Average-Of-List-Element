Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to practice working with lists in Python. Students are required to create a list of numbers and perform operations such as finding the sum and average of the elements in the list.

1. Instructions:
      
       1. Create a list of numbers (integer or floating-point) based on user input.
       2. Calculate the sum of all the numbers in the list.
       3. Calculate the average of the numbers in the list.


2. Constraints:

        The program should handle input constraints:

        1. define the size (number of elements) of the list.
        2. The program should ask to enter each element of the list.

   
3. Once the list is populated, the program should calculate and display the sum and average.

4. Ensure that the program can handle various edge cases, such as an empty list or a list containing negative numbers.

Example:
```python
Input1:
  Enter the number of elements: 5
  Enter element 1: 10
  Enter element 2: 20
  Enter element 3: 30
  Enter element 4: 40
  Enter element 5: 50

Output1:
  Sum of the numbers: 150
  Average of the numbers: 30.0



Input2:
  Enter the number of elements: 3
  Enter element 1: -5
  Enter element 2: 0
  Enter element 3: 5

Output2:
  Sum of the numbers: 0
  Average of the numbers: 0.0

```
